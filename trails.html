                <p>Great review! I had a blast on the West side of the loop last week.  I found a hidden gem in the old orchard field past the "Lazy S" spur.  If yu keep going pastthe trail marker, you'll find a fantastic run through a dried up gulley-wash.  Just stay clear of it on rainy days.

            <p>My buddies and I had heard about his trail in November from a friend who had finished the West portion earlier in the month.  It sounded like a good trail, but we didn't have time to check it out until last week.</p>

          <h3>Ojai Trail Facts</h3>
          <p>Ojai has over 200 miles of hiking and biking trails, with over 80 miles dedicated solely to moutain biking!  Most trails border working farms or ranches, so please take the time to learn your route before going, and pay careful attention to trail markers.  Ojai trails are mostly self mainted, so if you see a problem, try to fix it!  If the problem is a large one, contact one of the local cycling clubs to let them know, each month they have trail-repair day that is spent fixing problems.</p>

          <p>I'm going to be the first to admit, I don't like technical climbs, and I don't consider myself a good climber.  That's why, when my friend Heather asked me to go with her to the Copper Canyon Loop, or the "Coop" as it's called, I hesitated.  I've heard horror stories about the boulder climbs, poorly marked trails, and lack of trail upkeep</p>
